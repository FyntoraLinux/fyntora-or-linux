## Overview

This guide covers every aspect of creating a Linux distribution:

- **Foundation**: Using Oracle Linux as a stable, enterprise-grade base
- **Customization**: Modifying packages, configurations, and appearance
- **Independence**: Creating a truly independent distro with its own identity
- **Automation**: Building reproducible ISO images
- **Maintenance**: Long-term update and release management

## Why Oracle Linux as Base?

Oracle Linux provides several advantages as a foundation:

- **Stability**: Enterprise-grade stability and long-term support
- **Compatibility**: RHEL-compatible package ecosystem
- **Performance**: Optimized kernels and performance enhancements
- **Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK)**: Additional features and performance improvements
- **Free to Use**: No licensing costs for distribution

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A powerful build machine (minimum 16GB RAM, 8 CPU cores)
- At least 100GB free disk space
- Oracle Linux installed and updated
- Basic Linux system administration knowledge
- Understanding of package management and build processes

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Planning and Prerequisites](01-planning-and-prerequisites.md) section to understand the scope and requirements for your distribution.

## License and Legal Considerations

When creating a distribution based on Oracle Linux:

- Respect all open source licenses
- Provide proper attribution to Oracle and other projects
